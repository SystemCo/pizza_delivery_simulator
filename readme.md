## Project Phases
### Basic UI / UX
* Animated intro
    -> Timeout, Click, any button push
* Home Menu
    * Looks like pizza order menu
* Tutorial
* Controls
* Options (i.e. sound)
* Game Play
    -> Push the play game button from Home Menu
* Pause Menu
    -> Push esc while playing
* Exit Game
    -> Quit button, from home, from pause, alt+<F4>

### Animated Intro
* If intro is not complex enough, then not valid
    * Spinning world is not enough
    * Just Animated text is not enough
* Add scrolling backdrop, weelie, pizza boxes, etc. 

### Map features
* How to handle collisions with each element of the map
* Need to make an AABB collision function
* Need to have logic for what to do with each type of element
* Types
    * street lamp, building, water, sidewalk, etc

### Extra animation features
* Pizza guy dismounting to pick up the pizza
* Hit pedestrians explode!
* Add vehicle damage
    * Traffic
    * Player Motorcycle

### Add more traffic
* Add traffic pathing logic
* random?
    * Both
    * Different vehicle types have different levels of predictability
* Add pedestrians

### Extra game elements
* Money mechanics
* Things that cost money
    * Not delivering pizza on time
    * Accidents/crashes
    * Hitting pedestrians
    * Rent and water bills
        * random
* If you don't complete all deliveris, you're fired, game over
* Too many late deliveries and you're fired
    * shown by a "performance" meter?
    * Deliveries that are more late hurt your performance more;
    * Performance slowly fills back up.

## Ideas
### Title screen 
* Add text to the title screen
    * Animate the text.
* Make the motorcycle larger and realistically drive forward,
    Popping a weelie
* Add pizza to the motorcycle
    * Have the pizza fall off as part of the animation
* Add a menu to the title screen that can be clicked on
    * Have the buttons change color when hovered over
### Gameplay
* Add a goal to get from point a to point b
* Add a score system
* Add obstacles and a punishment for hitting those obstacles
* Add levels
